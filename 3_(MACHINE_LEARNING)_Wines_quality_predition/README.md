# Machine learning model that predicts wine quality


The model predicts wine quality based on its parameters using Support Vector Machine algorithm. <br>
Model enables the determination of lower-quality wines and maximizing profits simultaneously 
- Data used was highly unbalanced, with both poor and high-quality wines underepresented.
- Five different scalers were evaluated, and five different models were evaluated as well.
- A custom evaluation metric was introduced to ensure accurate predictions.
